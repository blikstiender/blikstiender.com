# About

Contained here are thoughts, musings, and various other attempts to reason through the world. The rationale behind starting this blog, the way I conceive of the writing in it, etc. are contained
in [this post](/writing/2025-05-25-why-blog-now). 

"Blikstiender" is a [West Frisian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Frisian_language) word meaning something between "darn" and "holy shit". I don't speak West Frisian (unfortunately), but do find expletives to be generally funny.

In creating a visual language for this website I employ the illustrations of famed naturalist [Ernest Haeckel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Haeckel). The favicon is Haeckel's
[illustration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Haeckel_Spumellaria.jpg) of [Spumellaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spumellaria). Below you can see his illustration of various members of the [Orchid family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchid). Haeckel's work hinged on careful observation. This observation led him to find beauty and order. It also led him to disproven, [racist](https://frontiersinzoology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12983-020-00358-w/figures/5) ideas that were weaponized to violent ends. 

I find Haeckel's journey instructive. It is through intentionally watching/listening/feeling the world that we arrive at interpretations about its structure. Yet, we should never let our conclusions blind us. The unexpected and under-considered is where truth and magic live.
