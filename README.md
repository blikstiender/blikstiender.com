My Personal Blog. Public, open, human-written.

## How this site works
This is a very-dumb (or straightforward, if you prefer) [Hugo Blog](https://gohugo.io/). Most of the 
writing is done in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). 

## Page Structure 
The structure of this blog is as below: 
```
/
/contact/
/writing/
|   ... all posts
/tags/
|   ...all tags
```
I'm writing it out mostly for my own documentation, so that inevitable subsequent refactors can 
preserve the website's structure. This information is also recorded in `/sitemap.xml`, although this 
file is dynamically generated. Still useful for back-checking I suppose.
